Computer Graphics, Assignment 4
=============================================

Follow the build instructions from Assignment 2, but replace
ASSIGNMENT2_ROOT with ASSIGNMENT4_ROOT.

This project loosly follows the structure of the "Ray Tracing in a Weekend"
book, and starts from Chapter 6 in the book. To solve the tasks that you were
given in the instructions (see Studentportalen), you mainly need to modify the
files main.cpp and raytracing.h/cpp, but you might have to modify some of the
other .h files as well.

Good luck!
